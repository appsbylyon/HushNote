HushNote is a simple notebook application that will allow you to keep track of several different notebooks.

The main screen of the application is your library.  It will display all notebooks that have been created.  When a notebook is selected it will open it.  If a password has been set you will need to enter it to view the entries.

To create a notebook simply press the "+" icon at the top right of the screen and enter a Title, description and password if desired.

Notebooks may be long pressed.  A menu will be displayed that will allow you to either delete or export a notebook.

Password Protection
HushNote allows you to protect your notebooks with a password.  Password protected notebooks are encrypted and will only be decrypted when the correct password has been entered.

After opening a notebook you will see a screen with your notebook title, description, date created and date modified.  A list will be displayed with all entries in the notebook.  To add an entry simply click the "+" button in the top right corner.  Enter a title and the text of your entry.

Entries may be long pressed.  A menu will be displayed that will allow you to edit or delete an entry.

Be aware that while a secured notebook is open a password will not be needed to delete entries.

If your notebook is secured and left open and another app is opened the notebook will be automatically closed after 5 seconds.  This is a security precaution that prevents others from opening HushNote after your password has been entered.

That's all there is to using HushNote.
